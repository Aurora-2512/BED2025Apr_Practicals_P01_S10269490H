I learned how to build RESTful API routes using Express and interact with a SQL Server database using the mssql library. Directly fetching the data inside route handlers is much easier than using function but if the application grew, i thought that it would be harder to read and maintain the program. One challenge I faced was managing database connections properly because even a small mistake can interrrupt the process to fetch data.
